        From looking at the opportunities and risks, we have come to a conclusion on what we believe is the best solution to this issue. 
        We believe that for internet censorship in China, the ideal solution is to lessen the restrictions online to allow the public to know what occurs on a global level and not just in China. They are currently isolated from the world and therefore, are unable to form any opinion on matters.

        There are a few possible choices which could be adopted to create this situation. One option is to strengthen the social supervision for the online environment. This is the idea of creating more trust between the government and users. This can be strengthened by making the government look trustworthy to the public. Some examples on how trust can be built is through an open government. An open government will allow citizens to have a greater awareness of what the government does (Opendatasoft, 2021). 
        Censorship is the repression of speech through suppressing and deleting anything considered objectionable to the state. Censorship is used by countries throughout the world, regardless of their regime types or developmental levels. 
        The Chinese state's deep-seated insecurity over regime stability has manifested itself in numerous Internet regulations. This control-based regulatory model, opposite a rights-based model to limit power abuse and protect user rights, is designed to minimize political risk, maintain social stability and spur economic development. Chinaâ€™s overly broad and vague policies provide flexibility for the state to regulate online content (Han 2016), while limiting individual expressions, public discourse, and collective actions (G. Yang, 2009).
        The government has focused on influential messengers who possess the power to catalyze public opinion. Under the 'harmonious society principle', any content that may jeopardize this goal may be filtered out whether or not it is for or against the government. The implementation of control is learnt through professional training and education or the everyday practice of self-censorship. 
        It adopts almost all kinds of online censoring operations, such as content filtering, IP address blocking, DNS hijacking etc.
