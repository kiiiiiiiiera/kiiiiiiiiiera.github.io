    <h1>Opportunities</h1>
    <h3>Removing internet censorship would allow more opportunites for internet users.</h3>


    <p><u>Potential opportunities which could be created by keeping the internet open are:</u></p>

    <h3>OPPORTUNITY: Empowering</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Empower sexual minorities and enlighten the public.</li>
        <li>How the internet influences the state-society relations in a traditionally sensitive issue area.</li>
        <li> Internet censorship may be beneficial in terms of forbidding pornographic content and violent terrorist information and containing the spread of rumors (Lu et al., 2016).
        </li>
    </ul>
        <p>
            Strict governmental censorship implemented through legal and technical means and the criminalization of online activities deemed as a subversive use of the Internet in China has led to the interesting phenomenon of self-censorship. 
            However, online news publications and consumption through social media upon which public opinion has been forming and evolving despite governmental censorship provide a justification for traditional media outlets to follow suit, helping to test or push the boundaries of self- and government-imposed censorship. Furthermore, the State does not support gay rights, but the ruling party of China is not ideologically against homosexuality either.
            Despite the official claim that criticism of its human rights record violates domestic sovereignty, the Chinese government does not care less about its international legitimacy than democracies.
        </p>

    <p>
        The firewall of China effectively blocks/limits the users' access to the outside world and limits freedom of speech
        Censorship is also a double-edged sword, in that while it can block discussion of individuals' scandals, it may also reduce opportunities for the public to praise the top leaders.
