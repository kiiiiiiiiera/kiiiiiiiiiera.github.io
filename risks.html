    <h1>Technology Risks</h1>
    <h3>Internet censorship may be beneficial in terms of forbidding pornographic content and violent terrorist information and containing the spread of rumors (Lu et al., 2016).</h3>

    <p><u>Potential risks which could be created by keeping the internet open are:</u></p>

    <h3>RISKS: Internet terrorism/ spread of rumors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cyberterrorism</li>
        <li>Usually has the goal to promote the attackers political, religious or social issue (Akhgar, et al. 2014).</li>
        <li>Can cause government attacks (Andress & Winterfeld, 2013).</li>
    </ul>
        <p>
          It is about using technology to create some damage or destruction on the internet. It usually has the goal to promote the attackers political, religious or social issue. 
          This currently happens in China with their government internet restrictions, however, if the Chinese government got rid of their restrictions, there is the risk that there will be some "cyberterrorists" who will use the internet to spread information about China, which would be destructive for the government.
        </p>
    <br>
    <h3>RISK: Data mining</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>They use software to find patterns in the user's data (Twin, 2021).</li>
          <li>Can be corrupt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Data mining is the process used by companies where they turn data into useful information. They use software to find patterns in the user's data. This allows businesses to learn more about customers.
        Data mining is not meant to be a negative tool on the internet, however, if some corrupt people were able to get their hands on a person's personal data then it will be very dangerous for the person affected.
        A person can be exposed to a privacy and security breaches, manipulation, discrimination and are able to get scammed more efficiently.
      </p>
    <br>
    <h3>RISK: Harmful content(Lu et al., 2016).</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Able to forbid content which could be harmful to internet users(Lu et al., 2016)</li>
          <li>Beneficial to users to have censorship</li>
          <li>Easier to catch illegal activity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Internet censorship may be beneficial to internet users as it can be used to forbid potentially harmful websites, such as pornographic content, violent terrorist information and false rumours (Lu et al., 2016).
        Therefore, removing internet censorship would allow internet users to be exposed to these harmful websites. This could be very risky as those who live in China have had all their actions monitored for so long. Therefore, when a user comes across one of these harmful websites, they could either not be aware that they are in a harmful situation or not know how to get out.  This could potentially have harmful effects such as PTSD, anxiety and stress (British Psychological Society, 2015).
        Removing internet censorship would also make it more difficult to catch those doing illegal activities online. This would make the internet a more dangerous place.
